# External APIs

## Overview

# This document identifies and details any external (third-party) API integrations utilized by the Creator's Deal Hub. It outlines their purpose, documentation links, authentication methods, key endpoints used, and any relevant rate limits or integration considerations. This ensures clarity for both human and AI development agents when interacting with services outside the core application.

## Existing/Implicit External Integrations

# While not explicitly called via external API keys in the current `package.json` for custom integrations, the following platforms form the foundational external dependencies:

### Supabase (for PostgreSQL)

# - **Purpose:** Provides managed PostgreSQL database hosting for Payload CMS.

- **Documentation:** [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs) (External Reference, not an internal link within the project documentation).

- **Base URL(s):** Specific to the Supabase project instance.

- **Authentication:** PostgreSQL protocol via connection string; Payload CMS handles this internally.

- **Rate Limits:** Subject to Supabase plan limits.

### Vercel (for Next.js Deployment)

# - **Purpose:** Hosting and deployment platform for the Next.js application (frontend and Payload CMS backend API routes).

- **Documentation:** [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs) (External Reference).

- **Base URL(s):** `https://[your-project-name].vercel.app`

- **Authentication:** Vercel CLI / Git integration.

- **Rate Limits:** Subject to Vercel plan limits.

## Potential Future External API Integrations

# Based on the market research and future capabilities outlined in the `Influencer App Research Framework` and `prd.md`, the following external APIs may be integrated:

### Social Media Platform APIs (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter/X, LinkedIn)

# - **Purpose:**

  - **Engagement Tracking & Analytics:** To fetch follower counts, engagement rates, comment data for "Authentic Engagement Verifier".

  - **Content Repurposing:** To ingest long-form content or publish short-form content for "Cross-Platform Content Reformat & Scheduler" or "AI-Powered Content Repurposing Assistant".

  - **Comment/DM Management:** To read and potentially respond to DMs/comments for "AI-Powered Comment/DM Response Assistant".

- **Documentation:** Specific to each platform (e.g., Instagram Graph API, YouTube Data API, TikTok for Developers, LinkedIn API).

- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 or proprietary API keys.

- **Rate Limits:** Vary widely by platform and API endpoint; often a significant constraint.

- **Integration Notes:**

  - Subject to frequent policy changes and API access restrictions by platforms.

  - Requires careful handling of user data and privacy.

### Payment Gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)

# - **Purpose:** To process payments for subscriptions or brand deals for "Simplified Brand Deal Tracker & Invoicer" or general monetization.

- **Documentation:** Specific to the chosen provider (e.g., [Stripe API Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api)).

- **Base URL(s):** Provider-specific.

- **Authentication:** API keys (Publishable and Secret keys).

- **Rate Limits:** Typically generous but should be monitored.

- **Key Endpoints Used (Example - Stripe):**

  - `POST /customers` - Create customer profiles.

  - `POST /payment_intents` - Process payments.

  - `POST /subscriptions` - Manage subscriptions.

- **Integration Notes:** Requires strict adherence to PCI compliance (if handling sensitive card data directly, though most integrations use hosted fields to offload this).

### Financial Data Aggregation APIs (e.g., Plaid, Finicity)

# - **Purpose:** To securely connect with users' bank accounts and other financial platforms to categorize income and expenses for the "Creator Tax Co-Pilot".

- **Documentation:** Provider-specific (e.g., [Plaid API Documentation](https://plaid.com/docs)).

- **Authentication:** API keys and OAuth 2.0 (for user consent).

- **Rate Limits:** Provider-specific.

- **Integration Notes:** Requires robust security measures and compliance with financial regulations.

### AI/ML Model APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini)

# - **Purpose:**

  - To power intelligent suggestions for "AI-Powered Thumbnail & Hook Generator" (for text generation for hooks) or "AI-Powered Content Repurposing Assistant" (for summarization/clipping logic).

  - To assist in generating niche/trend ideas for "AI-Powered Niche/Trend Spotter for Content Ideas".

  - To assist with personalized responses for "AI-Powered Comment/DM Response Assistant".

- **Documentation:** Provider-specific (e.g., [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs)).

- **Authentication:** API keys.

- **Rate Limits:** Usage-based, often with per-minute or per-day limits.

- **Integration Notes:**

  - Cost implications due to token usage.

  - Need to manage latency and potential API downtime gracefully.

  - Ethical considerations for AI-generated content.
