# Testing Strategy

## Overview

# This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Creator's Deal Hub project. It defines the philosophy, methodologies, tools, and best practices for ensuring software quality across the full stack (Next.js frontend, Payload CMS backend). The goal is to establish clear guidelines for both human and AI development agents to produce robust, reliable, and maintainable code.

## Testing Philosophy

# - **Balance**: Implement a balanced testing approach utilizing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, following the concept of a "testing pyramid."

- **Automation**: Prioritize automated testing to ensure rapid feedback and prevent regressions.

- **Early Detection**: Aim to catch defects as early as possible in the development cycle.

- **Maintainability**: Write tests that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

- **Coverage**: Strive for meaningful test coverage, focusing on critical paths and complex logic rather than merely chasing percentage metrics.

## Test Types and Organization

### Unit Tests

# - **Purpose**: To test individual functions, components, or modules in isolation, ensuring they work correctly without external dependencies.

- **Framework**: Jest (for both frontend and backend) (as a common choice for JavaScript/TypeScript projects, especially with React).

- **File Convention**: Test files should be named `[component/module].test.ts(x)` or `[component/module].spec.ts(x)` and placed alongside the code they test, or in a `__tests__` subdirectory.

- **Location**:

  - **Frontend**: `src/app/(frontend)/[feature]/__tests__/` or alongside components (e.g., `src/app/(frontend)/components/Header.test.tsx`).

  - **Backend (Payload CMS)**: `src/collections/[collection]__tests__/` or alongside Payload configuration/utilities (e.g., `src/payload.config.test.ts`).

- **Mocking Library**: Jest's built-in mocking capabilities.

- **Coverage Requirement**: Aim for a minimum of 80% code coverage for new or modified modules.**AI Agent Requirements:**- Generate unit tests for all new public functions, components, or methods.

- Cover expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions.

- Follow the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern.

- Mock all external dependencies (API calls, database interactions, global browser objects) to ensure isolation.

### Integration Tests

# - **Purpose**: To test the interaction between different units or components, verifying that they work correctly when integrated.

- **Scope**:

  - **Frontend**: Testing interactions between React components, or components interacting with a mocked API client.

  - **Backend**: Testing interactions between Payload CMS collections, services, and the database, or API routes with underlying business logic.

- **Location**: Dedicated `tests/integration/` directory within each respective application (`apps/web/tests/integration/` and `apps/api/tests/integration/` if a monorepo setup with separate apps subdirectories, or `src/tests/integration/` if co-located).

- **Test Infrastructure**:

  - **Database**: Utilize a separate test database (e.g., a dedicated PostgreSQL schema or an in-memory database like SQLite for lighter tests if suitable for mocking Payload's DB adapter) for integration tests to ensure isolation from development data. Testcontainers can be considered for spinning up real database instances in CI/CD.

  - **API**: For frontend integration tests, consider mocking the Payload CMS API responses using libraries like `msw` (Mock Service Worker) to simulate backend interactions.

  - **External Services**: Mock external API calls or third-party services.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

# - **Purpose**: To simulate real user scenarios and test the entire application flow from start to finish, including UI interactions, backend logic, and database operations.

- **Framework**: Playwright (recommended for its cross-browser capabilities and robust API).

- **Scope**: Critical user journeys (e.g., user registration, login, creating a new deal, sending an invoice, accessing contacts).

- **Environment**: Run against a deployed staging or dedicated E2E test environment that closely mirrors production.

- **Test Data**: Use a clean, consistent set of test data that can be programmatically set up and torn down before/after test runs.**AI Agent Requirements:**- Generate E2E tests for new critical user flows identified in user stories.

- Ensure tests cover both successful paths and common error scenarios.

- Automate test data setup and teardown for repeatable results.

## Test Data Management

# - **Strategy**: Use factories (e.g., `faker.js` combined with custom factories) to generate realistic but deterministic test data.

- **Fixtures**: Define JSON or TypeScript fixtures for static test data where appropriate.

- **Cleanup**: Ensure tests clean up any created data after execution to maintain test environment integrity.

## Continuous Testing

# - **CI Integration**: Integrate all automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Vercel's built-in checks, GitHub Actions if self-hosted).

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Encourage the use of pre-commit hooks (e.g., Husky with Lint-Staged) to run linting and unit tests before committing code.

- **Performance Tests**: Implement basic performance checks (e.g., Lighthouse CI in CI/CD) for critical pages.

- **Security Tests**: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
