## Requirements

These requirements are based on the analysis of your existing HTML files and the need to integrate them into your Next.js application following established architectural principles.

### Functional

* **FR1**: The static HTML content of `home.html`, `landing.html`, `pricing.html`, `about.html`, `carreers.html`, `contact.html`, and `404_Signal_Lost.html` must be accurately transformed into corresponding Next.js pages and reusable React components.
* **FR2**: Each page must be accessible via its designated route within the `src/app/(frontend)` route group (e.g., `/`, `/landing`, `/pricing`, `/about`).
* **FR3**: All client-side interactivity, including modals (Early Access, Auth, Mission Briefing, Waitlist), forms (Waitlist, Login/Signup, Contact, Application), navigation toggles, and dynamic content updates (e.g., pricing toggle, countdown timer, mission board display, AI demo interaction, timeline hovers, chart displays), must be fully functional using React state and event handlers.
* **FR4**: The Three.js and GSAP animations (e.g., starfield background, HUD item hovers, CTA glows, particle animations) must be preserved and correctly integrated into the Next.js components.
* **FR5**: Forms for waitlist, login/signup, contact, and job application must capture user input and simulate submission, providing appropriate visual feedback (e.g., success messages, error states). (Actual backend integration will be a future task).
* **FR6**: The pricing page's billing toggle must dynamically update the displayed prices for Creator and Business plans.
* **FR7**: The careers page must dynamically render "Open Missions" from a data source (e.g., an array of objects in the component itself for now) and trigger a mission briefing modal.
* **FR8**: The contact page's triage system must dynamically display the correct form based on user selection (Demo, Press, General).
* **FR9**: The landing page's interactive AI demo must simulate AI response typing and display a mock chart or text based on the selected prompt chip.
* **FR10**: The landing page's deals timeline must render dynamic bars and display popover details on hover.
* **FR11**: The landing page's cashflow chart must render dynamically when scrolled into view.
* **FR12**: The testimonial section on the landing page must include functional scroll buttons to navigate testimonials horizontally.

### Non Functional

* **NFR1**: The converted Next.js pages must maintain pixel-perfect visual fidelity to their original static HTML counterparts across all specified breakpoints.
* **NFR2**: The application must be fully responsive and adhere to a mobile-first design strategy, ensuring optimal display and usability on mobile devices before scaling to tablets and desktops.
* **NFR3**: Page load times for converted pages must be optimized to ensure a smooth user experience, leveraging Next.js features like static site generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR) where appropriate.
* **NFR4**: Animations (Three.js, GSAP, particle effects, typing animation, chart animations) must run smoothly at 60 FPS on target devices without causing jank or significant performance degradation.
* **NFR5**: All styling must be managed through Tailwind CSS utilities and a single global stylesheet (`src/app/(frontend)/styles.css`) for maintainability and consistency, leveraging Shadcn UI components.
* **NFR6**: The application must adhere to the `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` document for code consistency, naming conventions, and best practices.
* **NFR7**: User interaction flows, such as modal opens/closes and form submissions, must provide clear and immediate visual feedback.

### Compatibility Requirements

* **CR1**: All converted HTML and CSS must be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
* **CR2**: The converted frontend must seamlessly integrate with the existing Next.js App Router structure and Payload CMS backend without disrupting existing functionality (e.g., Payload admin panel).
* **CR3**: No breaking changes to the existing `Header.tsx` component or its integration in `layout.tsx` should occur during the conversion of other components.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

* New UI elements and pages will integrate seamlessly with the existing Next.js application's App Router structure.
* The `Header` component (already converted) and `StarfieldCanvas` (or similar particle canvas for `landing.html`) background will be integrated consistently across relevant pages.
* Existing global styles in `src/app/(frontend)/styles.css` will be the primary source for converted styles, with Shadcn UI components styled to fit.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

* **Homepage (`/`)**: Conversion of `home.html` into `src/app/(frontend)/page.tsx` with reusable components.
* **Landing Page (`/landing`)**: Conversion of `landing.html` into `src/app/(frontend)/landing/page.tsx` with new components.
* **Pricing Page (`/pricing`)**: Conversion of `pricing.html` into `src/app/(frontend)/pricing/page.tsx`.
* **About Us Page (`/about`)**: Conversion of `about.html` into `src/app/(frontend)/about/page.tsx`.
* **Careers Page (`/careers`)**: Conversion of `carreers.html` into `src/app/(frontend)/careers/page.tsx`.
* **Contact Us Page (`/contact`)**: Conversion of `contact.html` into `src/app/(frontend)/contact/page.tsx`.
* **404 Page (`/404_Signal_Lost` or `not-found.tsx`)**: Conversion of `404_Signal_Lost.html` into `src/app/(frontend)/404_Signal_Lost/page.tsx` (or leveraging Next.js's native `not-found.tsx`).
* **Modal Components**: `EarlyAccessModal`, `AuthModal`, `MissionBriefingModal`, `WaitlistModal` (from landing page).
* **Reusable Content Components**: `HeroSection`, `InfoSection`, `FoundersKeyCard`, `PricingCard`, `BillingToggle`, `MissionCard`, `TriageCard`, `ContactFormView`, `SuccessMessageView`, `HoloPanel`.
* **New Landing Page Components**: `LandingHeader`, `ParticleCanvas`, `AITypingDemo`, `DealsTimeline`, `CashflowChart`, `TestimonialCarousel`, `WaitlistModal` (from landing.html), `LandingFooter`.

### UI Consistency Requirements

* **Visual Fidelity**: Pixel-perfect match to the original HTML designs.
* **Component Reusability**: Maximize reuse of components for common UI patterns (e.g., buttons, input fields, modal structures, content sections), leveraging Shadcn UI where beneficial.
* **Mobile-First Adaptability**: Ensure all pages and components gracefully adapt from small mobile screens to large desktop displays.
* **Branding**: Maintain the established dark theme, font choices (`Inter`, `Share Tech Mono`), and accent colors (`#EEFC97`, `#A3E635`, `#C0FC32` from landing).

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

* **Languages**: TypeScript 5.7.3.
* **Frameworks**: Next.js 15.3.0, React 19.1.0.
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1.10.
* **3D Graphics**: Three.js 0.177.0.
* **Animation**: GSAP 3.13.0.
* **CMS**: Payload CMS 3.43.0.
* **Charts**: Chart.js (newly introduced by `landing.html`).
* **UI Component Library**: Shadcn UI (Latest Stable).

### Integration Approach

* **Code Integration Strategy**: Convert static HTML into `.tsx` files within the `src/app/(frontend)` directory, creating new React components. Prioritize using Shadcn UI components with customization where applicable.
* **Database Integration Strategy**: For the initial conversion, direct database interaction is minimal. Forms will simulate submission or integrate with Payload CMS APIs (already defined in `docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md`) as needed for waitlist/auth.
* **API Integration Strategy**: Frontend components will utilize `fetch` or a lightweight API client to interact with Payload CMS's auto-generated REST APIs (e.g., for user authentication, future data fetching).
* **Frontend Integration Strategy**: New components will be imported and composed within `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` files following Next.js App Router conventions. Shadcn UI components will reside in `src/components/ui/`.
* **Testing Integration Strategy**: New tests (unit, integration, E2E) will be added to the existing (conceptual) testing suite following the `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`.

### Code Organization and Standards

* **File Structure Approach**: Adhere to `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md` for component and page placement. This includes `src/components/ui/` for Shadcn UI components.
* **Naming Conventions**: Follow `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for variables/functions, as per `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.
* **Coding Standards**: Strict adherence to `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` for TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI practices.
* **Documentation Standards**: New code should include JSDoc comments where appropriate and adhere to general Markdown standards for documentation files.

### Deployment and Operations

* **Build Process Integration**: The converted frontend will be part of the existing Next.js build process.
* **Deployment Strategy**: Leverage Vercel's existing deployment pipeline for Next.js applications.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

* **Technical Risks**:
    * **Fidelity Loss**: Risk of not perfectly replicating original HTML/CSS/JS. **Mitigation**: Meticulous component breakdown, pixel-perfect review, automated visual regression (future).
    * **Performance Degradation**: Risk of slower performance due to React overhead or unoptimized 3D/animation. **Mitigation**: Leverage Next.js SSG/SSR, optimize Three.js/GSAP/particle effects, implement code splitting and lazy loading.
    * **Interactivity Bugs**: Risk of misimplementing complex JavaScript interactions from static HTML. **Mitigation**: Thorough unit/integration testing of interactive components, manual QA.
    * **Shadcn UI Customization Complexity**: Difficulty aligning Shadcn components perfectly with existing custom designs while maintaining their integrity. **Mitigation**: Clearly defined theming in `ui-ux-spec.md`, rigorous visual QA, judicious use of `cn` utility.
* **Integration Risks**:
    * **Styling Conflicts**: Risk of Tailwind CSS conflicting with existing global styles or custom styles interacting unexpectedly with Shadcn. **Mitigation**: Ensure all original CSS is carefully migrated to `styles.css` with Tailwind directives or equivalent.
* **Deployment Risks**: Minimal, as existing Vercel pipeline is robust for Next.js.
* **Mitigation Strategies**:
    * **Incremental Conversion**: Break down conversion into small, testable stories.
    * **Automated Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for converted components.
    * **Visual QA**: Conduct thorough manual and automated (future) visual QA against original HTML.

## Epic and Story Structure

This enhancement will be structured under a single, comprehensive epic, broken down into sequential stories that build upon each other to complete the conversion. The existing `story1.1.md` provides a precedent.

### Risk Assessment

* **Top 5 risks by severity**:
    1.  **Fidelity Loss**: Potential for visual bugs or inconsistencies.
    2.  **Interactivity Bugs**: Risk of complex JavaScript logic not translating perfectly.
    3.  **Performance Degradation**: Animation/3D effects may impact load times or smoothness.
    4.  **Shadcn UI Customization Complexity**: Ensuring Shadcn components perfectly match existing designs can be challenging.
    5.  **Rollback Complexity (Medium)**: While low likelihood, the effort to revert substantial frontend changes could be medium.
* **Mitigation recommendations**: Proactive visual QA, thorough testing of interactive components, performance optimization, and strict adherence to styling guidelines. For Shadcn UI, careful initial setup and iterative theming are crucial.
* **Timeline impact of addressing issues**: Addressing these proactively (via thorough testing and code review) minimizes rework and prevents major delays. Reactive fixes would significantly impact timelines.

### Recommendations

* **Must-fix before development**: None. The architecture is well-defined for the current scope.
* **Should-fix for quality**: Implement automated visual regression testing to compare converted pages against original HTML.
* **Consider for improvement**: Explore more advanced performance profiling tools for the Next.js frontend, especially for pages with heavy animations or 3D graphics.
* **Post-MVP deferrals**: Any new external API integrations or complex backend services are correctly out of scope for this frontend conversion.

### Frontend-Specific Assessment

* **Frontend architecture completeness**: High. The document thoroughly covers component architecture, state management, routing, styling, testing, and security from a frontend perspective, now with Shadcn UI integration.
* **Alignment between main and frontend architecture docs**: Excellent. The `brownfield-architecture.md` aligns perfectly with the foundation laid by `fullstack-architecture.md` and `frontend-architecture.md` (which was already a part of the analysis for fullstack).
* **UI/UX specification coverage**: Comprehensive. The `docs/architecture/ui-ux-spec.md` provides strong guidance for visual fidelity and interaction design.
* **Component design clarity**: High. The component breakdown and proposed reusable components in this document, along with `docs/architecture/components.md`, provide clear guidance on custom and Shadcn components.

### Final Decision

-   **APPROVED**: The plan is comprehensive, properly sequenced, and ready for implementation.
