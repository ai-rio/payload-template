### Story 1.17: Assemble Homepage (`page.tsx`)

As a developer, I want to assemble the complete homepage, so that all core components are integrated into a final, functional page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `src/app/(frontend)/page.tsx` file imports and renders the `Header`, `StarfieldCanvas`, `HeroSection`, `InfoSection` (multiple instances), and `Footer` components.
2.  The assembled `page.tsx` is visually identical to the `home.html` file, including all responsive behaviors and animations.
3.  All interactive elements on the homepage (buttons, modals, scroll events) function correctly.

#### Integration Verification

* The homepage (`/`) loads without errors and matches `home.html` visually.
* All interactive elements on the homepage are fully functional.
