### Story 1.18: Assemble Landing Page (`/landing/page.tsx`)

As a developer, I want to assemble the complete landing page, so that all its components are integrated into a final, functional page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `src/app/(frontend)/landing/page.tsx` file imports and renders the `LandingHeader`, `ParticleCanvas`, `AITypingDemo`, `DealsTimeline`, `CashflowChart`, `TestimonialCarousel`, `LandingPricingSection`, `LandingFooter`, and `WaitlistModalLanding` components.
2.  The assembled `landing/page.tsx` is visually identical to the `landing.html` file, including all responsive behaviors and animations.
3.  All interactive elements on the landing page function correctly.

#### Integration Verification

* The landing page (`/landing`) loads without errors and matches `landing.html` visually.
* All interactive elements on the landing page are fully functional.
