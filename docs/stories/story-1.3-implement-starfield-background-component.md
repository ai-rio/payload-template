### Story 1.3: Implement Starfield Background Component

As a user, I want to see the animated starfield background, so that the site has a visually engaging experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `StarfieldCanvas.tsx` component correctly encapsulates and renders the Three.js animation from `home.html` and `404_Signal_Lost.html`.
2.  The canvas is positioned as a fixed background, allowing content to scroll over it.
3.  The Three.js animation runs smoothly without performance issues.

#### Integration Verification

* The animated background is visible behind the content on the homepage.
* Scrolling the page does not interfere with the background animation.
